# Project Title  
## Public API Requests

## Getting Started

Using `fetch()`, this app retrieves a list of 12 random employees with a nationality (`nat`) of "US" and displays them as cards on the page.

Click on any employee card to open a modal window with detailed information about that employee.

Inside the modal, you can close it by clicking the **×** button or navigate between employees using the **Prev** and **Next** buttons.

Start typing in the search box to instantly filter employees by name.

## Extras

- Switched the font to **Roboto** for a clean, modern look.  
- Added subtle box shadows on cards when hovered for better visual feedback.  
- Smooth transitions on card hover for improved user experience.
